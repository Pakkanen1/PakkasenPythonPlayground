    <h1>My GM Journey</h1>
    <p>
        I started playing tabletop role-playing games back in 2016. My first touch to the hobby was of course D&D 5th edition, which is still like 90% of my current TTRPG experiences.
        I then started running 5e games for my friends in mid 2019 and later using different systems.
        On this page I (try to) recall all of my past campaigns and oneshots, condensing what happened in those games and what was my personal and possibly my players' take away from the game.
        Sessions will be in chronological order, which I hope results in providing interesting insights and developments about how I think about TTRPGs and GMing.
    </p>

    <h2>#1: The Delian Tomb</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length: </strong>Oneshot</li>
        <li><strong>Setting/Type: </strong>Heroic Fantasy</li>
        <li><strong>System: </strong>D&D 5E</li>
        <li><strong>Players: </strong>Total of 3 players with 1 first timer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        My first time being the dungeon master was with the help of Matt Colville's prewritten "Delian Tomb" oneshot.
        The adventure is basically a rescue mission, as a farmer's son is kidnapped by goblins from the farmstead. The farmer organizes multiple search parties and the players are one of those parties.
        I had 3 friends playing, with one of them being completely new to DnD, but I had showed him how to make a character easily using DNDBeyond on a flight a few weeks before.
        I had never prepped before and I can't remember which "how to GM" videos I watched, but I don't think it was too many. Probably the short "DM tips" videos with Matt Mercer.
        So most of my prep was just reading the adventure PDF and writing bullet points about it in a small black notebook. I think I actually jotted down every single goblin with their name, hp, loot and 1 unique characteristic.
        Then I drew a small version of the dungeon map in my notebook as well. I had written notes for each possible encounter in the PDF, but also 1 homebrew encounter I thought would be interesting if we had the time.
        <br><br>
        Playing was quite fun! I got to improvise and act out wacky NPCs, such as a cranky carpet merchant, who's cart the players were riding on at the beginning.
        They are part of a caravan that I had improvised to be going from Maribor to Vizima, thinking that I would be running future campaigns in the Witcher universe.
        The players had made very self-centered characters so it was easy enough to motivate them with money. There was a small encounter with boars, then they tracked down the goblins in the tomb,
        dealt with the bugbear and undead, getting the magic sword and rescuing the youngest Mabbet. The kid was of course crying after being kidnapped and caged and at this point the renegade
        side of the PCs started to come out more as they figured putting him back in the cage and carrying him back to the farm was a "safer" way... little did I know this
        was only the beginning of their antics. I think they eventually fed him honey to stop the crying, but by that point the PCs had firmly semented themselves as a-holes.
        <br><br>
        The adventure didn't take long, so I thought it would be fine to run a quick bonus encounter. Once the PCs arrive
        back at the farmstead, they are met with an eerie silence and grim sight, as the bodies of those that didn't join
        a search party are now laying in the yard. A bloodthirsty werewolf then emerges from the farmhouse, growling at the players.
        Of course the barbarian's first instinct is to offer the kid as a distraction/sacrifice, but the werewolf kicks the cage aside for bigger prey.
        <br>
        So they then slay the werewolf to my surprise and impale every single dead body in the farmstead, afraid that they
        would be infected with lycanthropy. At this point I had the werewolf retract back to its human form, revealing the
        carpet merchant to be culprit. Then I had the farmer return with his search party, who of course assumed the players
        caused the massacre, since there was no werewolf in sight and all of the corpses were impaled with the barbarian's greatsword.
        I think with more careful examination it would have been obvious that a werewolf did it, but I remember the PCs being
        their rude selves so things escalated.
        <br>
        After the final fight vs the farmer (who was a war veteran), the warlock died of his wounds and the other PCs dumped him the well for some reason.
        Then they set the whole farm on fire and rode off into the sunset, while the kid (who was the only survivor) watched his home burn.<br>
        Except that the fighter (the one playing DnD for the 1st time) said he goes back to the farm and beheads the kid... yeah I was not expecting that.
        So now the session actually ended, with the 2 surviving PCs riding off to presumably cause more chaos.
    </p>
    <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
        The biggest realization was seeing how easy it was actually to run a game. DMing/GMing had been demystified forever for me now as being something extremely hard and requiring immense dedication.
        Don't get me wrong - GMing is difficult, but the truth is that the games that you run are as time-consuming and grandiose as you make them. The goal is to have fun, and prepping in a way that satisfies you and your players is enough.
        In this instance, it was already loads of fun to run the Delian Tomb as is, but adding that twist at the end made it something that I will remember for the rest of my life and probably the players as well.
        <br>
        That said I think the session did drag just little too long because of the werewolf encounter.

    <h2>#2: The Black Qubo</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length: </strong>Oneshot</li>
        <li><strong>Setting/Type: </strong>Heroic Fantasy (Urban)</li>
        <li><strong>System: </strong>D&D 5E</li>
        <li><strong>Players: </strong>3</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
		I had played my second ever character in a 5e oneshot recently during this time. Donny Adello was a tortle rogue who was socially quite inept. I loved this character so much that I decided to run a oneshot where he was the villain.<br>
		Two of my players were the same as oneshot #1, but this time the setting was the same as my regular DM's world: Valcia. The players were bounty hunters in the city of Dia and they were tasked to find the mysterious "Black Qubo", who 
		had eluded them for months. The mission started in the guard house where wanted posters were being handed out. I remember that the clerk told the party about the theft of salt bags. Then the players went to scout out the slums where Black Qubo's right hand man was said to be lurking. 
		They asked around, paying some beggars well to get some good info. In the end they are led to the wingman's apartment, surprising their quarry just outside the building. They catch him with a net and mercilessly interrogate him inside his own apartment. 
		I had some of the gang's Kenku infiltrate the house from the roof during the interrogation, but the players were able to dispatch them with some minor wounds.<br><br>
		
		During the fight though, the wingman fled. Luckily the ranger was able to hunter's mark him before and they were able to track him down, since they the general direction he was. They followed him to the sewers,
		dealing with some traps and finding the gang's hideout. They beat up the wingman and his cronies, but no sign of Black Qubo. There was however a very peculiar chamber in the hideout: a whirlpool of sewer water with submerged double doors.
		I can't remember how the party got past the whirlpool, but behind the double doors they found Black Qubo's lair. The lair was a miniature copy of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles hideout. <br><br> 
		
		When the party initially encounters Donny "Black Qubo" Adello, they have a pleasant chat and find out that Donny is more of a Robin-Hood type character, but all of the thugs that follow him are probably controlled by the wingman. 
		But while searching the place, the party actually found the stolen salt: it was all in a crate that had the body of a dead ratfolk in it. Donny simply said that he just wanted to preserve his master's remains. 
		When the Lawful-Good Hilpert Hilpe√§ saw this, he  shot Donny with a crossbow.<br>
		The fight wasn't very long. Donny had the same stats as the Black Viper from Waterdeep: Dragon Heist and 3 vs 1 was a cakewalk for the players. Then when the players delivered Donny back to the guard house and collected the bounty. THE END! Or was it?
		In my notes I had few lines about an encounter where rogues would try to free Black Qubo while he was being escorted back to the guard house, but for the life of me I can't remember if I just skipped that part.<br><br>
		
		Easter Egg: In our usual game where I was a player, we had just completely derailed the campaign and become outlaws to the city of Dia, so I had a small cameo of our party's wanted posters. I thought I was being very clever :D
    </p>
	
	<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
		My notes about this oneshot prove that you don't need much to run a fun game: <a href="qubonotes.png">Qubo Prep Notes</a> <br>
        However the notes are quite bad... I had to improvise A LOT and in the end I think the main reason this game was fun was because of the players. 
		There was one player in particular who I think helped me to improvise better. 
		Since he was very engaged and excited about the game, all of the players were discussing possibilities on what to do and where to go. 
		Since the players were actively discussing all the time, I was able to pick up a lot of good idead and incorporated them into the session. 
		If I had run this game for 3 inexperienced roleplayers, I think it could have turned out pretty bad.
		<br><br>
		In short: Listen to your players as they have great ideas! (and stop making very chaotic prep notes)
    </p>

    <h2>#3: Donny's Great Escape</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Length: </strong>Oneshot</li>
        <li><strong>Setting/Type: </strong>Heroic Fantasy</li>
        <li><strong>System: </strong>D&D 5E</li>
        <li><strong>Players: </strong>5</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This was the largest table I've had, but I had the same players so I was confident it would be fun. I started prep
        on an adventure where a group was tasked to free Donny from a prison called "Iron Maiden" and like many of my prep
        sessions, it started with a drawing. I drew an Alcatraz-like prison from an isometric perspective and that was
        enough inspiration to begin writing potential scenes. <br>
        My notes this time actually made sense - I had X number of scenes that I had jotted down some bullet points for.
        I had watched some Youtube videos about how to run a prison break and the main takeaway from those was to have
        very low hp guards, so that the players could feasibly stealth through the prison. However I also wanted a more
        pressing threat, so I made the warden super powerful and I added a famed mercenary band to patrol the prison. <br><br>

        The adventure itself began with the players meeting a crime boss at the end of a stormy headland. The crime boss
        gave them the task of busting out Donny Adello for a hefty reward as Donny had information that the boss needed to know.
        The prison had a "teleportation shield", meaning you could only infiltrate by traveling to the island itself.
        However the night was ideal as the weather hid the party's rowboat when they infiltrated the prison through it's
        sewer system. <br>
        On the lowest floor, the party quietly neutralized some guards bathing before moving upwards. They sneaked through
        the cell-section, not interacting with any of the inmates and made it outside of the lowest prison block. The
        roof of this building was used as a loading bay with multiple crates/barrels stacked about and a couple of airships
        anchored.<br>
        The party witnesses the famed Lazarus Brothers being welcomed to the prison by the warden at the mouth of an airship.
        The brothers disperse to seemingly patrol different parts of the prison, while the warden retreats to his offices.
        <br>
        The party knows Donny is in the "Tower" - the westernmost prison block, connected only by a rope bridge to the main prison.
        I think one of them had an invisibility potion or a spell, so they made it to the tower pretty easily.
        Donny's cell was located at the top of the tower and when the players arrive, they are jumped by 2 of the Lazarus brothers.
        They manage to defeat them but the alarm is sounded, so they are now on a clock to escape before guards swarm the tower.
        <br>
        There is a pit and a chain that goes through multiple levels, acting as a kind of an elevator.
        The pit continues through the lowest level as well, so the party takes a risk and decides to try and escape that way.
        But when they arrive at the lowerst level, Banhart Lazarus, the eldest of the brothers enters the tower. He is a
        high level fighter/sorcerer and incinerates many of the escaped prisoners. The party manages to defeat him though
        and enter the cave under the tower. They notice a great chain, as if some large animal has escaped and created
        a passage down to the depths of the earth. The party escape through this passage with Donny in tow...
    </p>

    <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
		Drawing maps is fun! Other than that, this was probably in my top 3 worst sessions, but that also means I learned a lot.<br>
        First of all, I overprepped extensively. Here are some of the things I view as overprep for this oneshot:
        <ol>
            <li>1. I mapped out almost the entire prison with its 4 big buildings... for a ONESHOT.</li>
            <li>2. I statted out the warden, even though it was veeeery unlikely the players would fight him.</li>
            <li>3. I created player characters for each of the 7 Lazarus brothers and their mother. DNDBeyond helped but this was overkill.</li>
            <li>4. I created a more than a one-line long backstory for the Lazarus brothers and the Warden.</li>
            <li>5. I built Banhart and Mother Lazarus as custom minis in Hero Forge</li>
        </ol>
        So some of these points might seem like they were not overprep, but for a ONESHOT they certainly were.
        For example I used a free software (with terrible user experience) to grid out these huge, gray prison blocks. I hated preparing the map, but it felt like I need a gridded map.
        What I should have done was to just run the whole thing as a point crawl, but my experience as a player had steered me towards more gridded gameplay.
        <br>
        But by far my biggest mistake was trying to create way too much content for a oneshot. The players only fought 3
        of the 7 brothers, they only saw 1/4 of the prison and interacted with maybe 10% of it. And even then I had way
        too many scenes. Stuff actually happened during the first and last hours of the game, and the session ran for at least 5 hours.<br>
        I was so tired and fatigued, even though there were only 2 combats that were relatively fast since there was a lot of
        fluff with sneaking through the prison, which felt empty and boring.
        <br><br>
        TLDR: The session's premise was fun, but it was a slog. I also made it unfun and disappointing for myself for overprepping.

    </ul>
    <p>
        My first campaign! During this time, Witcher was my jam, so naturally I wanted to run a campaign in its world. All my life I've hated reading books, but after playing Witcher 3 for 100+ hours, I decided to buy the first Witcher book and started wondering why I ever hated reading books!<br>
        The Last Wish is still one of my favorite books and very quickly I devoured the entire Witcher Saga, reading half and listening to half on audiobooks. After reading nothing but Witcher, I decided to try another audiobook on a whim: The Lies of Locke Lamora. I was blown away by the book and it quickly became my new favorite and pretty much the reason I wanted to run an urban campaign in DnD.<br>
        So I loved the Witcher and about half of my players also liked it, so I pitched a "gangs of Novigrad" campaign.<br><br>

        I'm not going to summarize the whole campaign but here are some highlights:<br>
        0. Characters: Ben Faphi (deceased), Roy Hughes (deceased), Pawn (retired), Hagnulf Frassugson, Porke Brand, Regal Wilder, Ciedet "Cid" Van Brydyn
        1. The King of Beggars "Padre" is worried as his lieutenants are getting murdered. The campaign begins with one of them dying to poison in the same table where the players are playing Gwent. They are naturally suspected and given 1 week to clear their name by finding the real killer. I remember there was some way that Padre would know if the left the city, who basically owned the place.
        2. Ben dies after Pawn throws a dart at him a lvl1, after rolling a nat 1 on an advantageous attack. 
        3. Porke Brand is sent to replace Ben and they follow a cold trail into a warehouse where they have a pretty cool ambush initiated by a visiting player
        4. Players find a teleporter in the warehouse that takes them to a cave where there are werebears that come from Skellige
        5. The werebears are seemingly led by a Ophelia the Necromancer that Roy had a grudge against. Roy then dies to a trap while investigating her office alone. He rolled 2 successes on death saves and then 3 failures in a row. Pawn leaves after losing his best friend.
        6. I think they fight a Katakan disguised as one of the gang leaders here... can't remember why.
        7. Padre and many important people like the Hierarch are kidnapped during a secret meeting.
        8. The players track them and end up teleporting to Skellige and fighting more werebears. Hagnulf the druid uses his op wolf summons and wins the day.
        9. They then fight a Frankenstein's monster created by Regal's nemesis: Barney. After killing Barney, his notebook reveals that the necromancer is Regal's mother.
        10. They then get ambushed by Ophelia but manage to kill her. She reveals that Regal was to be her "perfect" creation when they use speak with the dead on her.
        11. The players interrupt a ritual and finally confront the puppetmaster: Gudrun Bjornsdottir. She was betrayed by the other gang leaders and has been enacting her revenge with the help of her new warlock patron. It culminates when she is sacrificing Padre and some others to her patron. The players of course stop her.

    </p>
    <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
		So for a first campaign, this was a success in my opinion, but at times it did feel overwhelming. I think my approach to the prepping the city wasn't completely wrong, but it could have been much better. I didn't do enough prep all around the city, which led to a more railroady feel for this campaign. I did make a random encounter table for the city too, but I didn't really understand how to use it properly. <br>
        I remember two very big lessons: session 8 was not good & the final fight was too easy. I didn't give enough direction during session 8 and the players weren't sure where to go, but the bigger problem was excluding one player completely. I only noticed it at the end, but since the party went to a brothel to gather info, the paladin stayed outside... doing nothing for pretty much the whole session.<br>
        As for the Gudrun fight, she didn't have enough abilities. She had a lot of hitpoints, but even with her 3 attacks the players just overwhelmed her when there were no minions to help.<br><br>
        All in all, it was very fun and I will certainly look back at this fondly, but I also want to run a better campaign.
