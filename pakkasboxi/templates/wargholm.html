        <h3>Session 0: Hoard of the Sea Wolf King</h3>
        <p>
            Group of aspiring adventurers from the village of Skargat have arrived on rowboats at the flooded sea caves on the southern coast of Big Andrik. 
            Their goal is to prove their bravery in this coming-of-age challenge. They are to gather 200 gold pieces from the danger-laden Tomb of King Skorgald. 
            Upon arrival a group of 4 negotiate their way past some bandits and steal some of their equipment in the next room. They make their way past a hall detailing 
            the history of King Skorgald and his legendary deeds such as the sacking of Lysfinn and the slaying of the Drake Igald. <br><br>
            The group makes it to a winding cave system with bat droppings everywhere. One of the party holds a torch to the ceiling, angering the stingbats that rest there. 
            In the ensuing chaos, 2 of them perish as the bloodsuckers descend on them. The survivors retreat and are soon reinforced by a pair of new adventurers. <br>
            At this point the group negotiates with the bandits for an alliance. Only one dim-witted bandits stays, while the others steal a boat. Continuing their delve 
            into the caves, the party manages to sneak past the stingbats this time and they encounter some nords. Two Sea Wolves are guarding a cavern entrance, but the 
            party doesn't get much out of them, only that they gotta piss off as Garatha is the one who will claim Skorgald's treasure.<br><br>
            Moving on the party finds some valuable pearls in an empty Siren den and fight a gray ooze. Nearby they spot a statue of Thor who is wearing a beautiful elven cloak. 
            One of the party tries to grab it and the statue fries them with lightning. Canute Erling then decides to try and grab the cloak again, but luckily Freja Nyland pushes 
            them out of the way just in time. Canute gains the Cloak of Elvenkind and the party moves on. They spot a wide lake and decide to backtrack to the boats and go explore it. 
            On the center of this small underground lake, they find a small island that is Skorgald's resting place. Skorgald, now a draugr emerges from the stone and addresses the party: 
            <em>"Bring me the head of Garatha, the last of my traitorous blood, so that I may rest in peace at last!"</em> Understanding that this means Skorgald would leave behind a heap of 
            gold and the Axe of Nines Eyes, the party begins scheming. <br><br>
            With the cunning of Audun Helvig, the party convinces Garatha that they just want to serve her. They would lead Garatha to Skorgald's treasure if they were escorted safely out with their pearls. 
            Garatha takes the bait and they lead the whole group of berserkers to the lake. Once landed, Skorgald attacks Garatha's crew while the party watches from their boat on the lake. 
            Garatha's head is the first to roll from Skorgald's attacks and only a handful manage to flee the impervious draugr. The party are then awarded the Axe of Nine Eyes and 500 gp. <br><br>
            Surivors: Audun Helvig, Eirik Holmen, Canute Erling, Freja Nyland

        <h3>Session 1: Carousing and goblin killin'</h3>
        <p>
            After the long winter, the party had risen to lvl 1. At the beginning Olaf Nyland called a town meeting and declared that they would raid the Rolug - the village of seers. 
            This was to happen after 30 days of preparation for the raid. Freja noticed his fathers health was not great and their new village seer, Brugatha, was a bit too close to his ear. 
            Olaf claimed his wife had died because of the old seer and conveniently Brugatha had arrived only a few days later to fill the vacancy. Nevertheless the party would join their Jarl on the raid.
            <br>
            The party started out with carousing and got rumors about a talking bear and an abandoned Dverg forge. They decided to go look for the talking bear. 
            Some armed themselves with Smith Hagen and his daughters weaponry, while others like Canute went to Marvolo's Market - an exotic goods market run by a goblin foreigner. Canute became a club member and was given a stamp card for health potions. 
            Afterwards Canute went to visit Hanna Elwinsdottir the Apotechary. Hanna's roof had collapsed in as she was making acorns that ignited like grenades when thrown. Canute bought some of those too.
            <br><br>
            Once the party went into the woods they encountered a group of naked goblins having target pratice on a carved out picture of a bear. Once the party talks to them 
            they find out they had been hunting the talking bear but the bear had killed many of them. The fanatical goblins then thought the party were here to steal their kill and 
            began attacking. Eirik went down immediately, but the others managed to help him back up. Canute threw his acorns and managed to take out most of the goblins while Freja and Audun cleaned up. <br>
            With Eirik so battered, they decided to rest under the big tree. Their sleep was interrupted by approaching torchlight. Bursting out of the trees was a Treant chased by 
            many red-cloaked Sea Wolves from Valthis. The Valthisians had torches and were burning the Treant, but the Treant was running toward the party. The party backed up and 
            the Treant awakened another Treant from the big tree they were resting under. Once Freja saw one of the Treants effortlessly crush one of the redcloaks, the party decided to flee into the dark forest.
            <br><br>
            Cold and tired, the party arrives at a longhouse hidden in the woods. In the pattering rain, they knock on the door and are met with a grizzly hermit. 
            He introduces himself as Ogden and welcomes the party in to rest for the night.
        </p>

        <h3>Session 2: Fanatical Goblin Soup</h3>
        <p>
            When the party awakes, Ogden offers them green soup, which Freja deduces to be made of goblins. Eirik asks Ogden about the talking bear but he doesn't have an answer. 
            However Ogden does tell of the goblins that arrived upon Andrik at the end of winter. The forest around their cave had started dying out and this worries Ogden very much. 
            The party decides to investigate and find themselves at a cave mouth where all of the green forest around it has turned black. <br>
            They spot a goblin hunting party arriving at the cave and ambush them. With the hunters taken care of they notice some of them are wearing seafaring garbs. 
            The curious party enters the cave, fighting skeletons, normal goblins and fanatical goblins. At the end of the cave they find a glowing purple gemstone. After a fight 
            with a goblin shaman the purple light expands and the party sees a vision of skinless giants rising from the ground in a faraway land. <br><br>
            The party then returns to Ogden to rest. In the morning Ogden vows and oath to the gods to restore the forest to its former beauty and the party bears witness. 
            Afterwards the party returns to Skargat and goes straight to Marvolo. Marvolo lets it slip that he had a pirate crew of goblins who went insane after they found the cave. 
            The party then goes to the Cup & Axe for a well deserved drink...

        <h3>Session 3: Flameless Forge of the Dverg (part 1)</h3>
        <p>
            Skald Horf Peikonsoittaja sings with the players while they carouse: 
            <em>
                "<br>Odin silmÃ¤Ã¤nsÃ¤ pyÃ¶rittÃ¤Ã¤, kun Signen saaliit ryÃ¶vÃ¤tÃ¤Ã¤n! Huh-hei, huh-hei, huh-hei, HUH! 
                <br>Jaarli Signe vendetan vannoi mut silti vaan vaippansa vaihtoi! Huh-hei, huh-hei, huh-hei, HUH! 
                <br>Signen poika RulfinrÃ¤Ã¤pÃ¤le, rohkeutta rouskun rouskutti, sillÃ¤ Valthislaiset vaipan tarvii, kun muuten vana virstaa tulvii! Huh-hei, huh-hei, huh-hei, HUH!"
            </em>
            <br>
            This song angers some of the Valthisians in Cup & Axe and the party is dragged into a bar fight. Luckily they win the fight and the battered Valthisians are thrown out by Hagen. 
            Unfortunately Audun got the shits from the goblin soup and is bedridden so he couldn't help.
            <br><br>
            The players buy Birgitta the Donkey from Marvolo and some supplies before heading out to explore the Dverg Forge they heard about. On the way they fight giants wasps and harvest their stingers. 
            When they arrive at the general location where they believe the forge is hidden, Canute finds a cave behind a waterfall. They leave Birgitta outside and enter the cave.<br>
            They come to a crossroads and follow the upper path, coming to a hot spring. However there is a big Rock Troll bathing under a small waterfall inside the spring. The party 
            then retreats back and takes the lower path, coming to a mined-out cave with a large stone slab in the middle. The slab has the dwarven rune for "ascend" on it. Canute is able to 
            lift the slab they see a deep pit beneath. Eirik knows dwarven so he gets on the slab and exclaims: "descend" in dwarven. The slab begins moving down like an elevator and the party hops onto it.
            <br><br>
            Now deep inside the earth, the party comes to a large built room with racks of weapon and armor. They see that the armor is completely made of mithral and Freja tries to grab it. 
            As she does, the items begin to move and form into 3 animated armors. With the help of Freja's berserk, they manage to defeat the armors without taking much damage. The party 
            now has a bunch of mithral armor and weapons that have a strange black hue. <br>
            Continuing their delve with high spirits they come across cast-iron chests. Everyone starts moving these chests toward the elevator when they hear a terrible metallic screech from the 
            end of the hallway as a large iron construct in the shape of a blocky humanoid appears. Steam exhausts from its joints as it walks and a set of 3 gems glow behind a trellis in its chest. 
            Eirik and Freja drop their chests and bolt for the elevator, but Canute greedily drags the heavy chest along. This means that the construct catches up with Canute and crushes him under its fists. 
            Eirik and Freja make a split-second decision to rescue their village idiot. Eirik is able to heal Canute while Freja holds up a shield wall. Once all of them recover, they bolt for the elevator. <br>
            As the elevator is ascending, the construct grabs it and its mouth begins to open. The party is able to pry off the monstrosity's hands with a crowbar and are able to flee with their lives. 
            When the party is leaving the dungeon, they encounter a Sea Hag by the waterfall. They manage to leave with the promise of never coming back to her lair. While escaping Canute catches a glimpse of the hag's cauldron 
            and sees an image of Jarl Olaf rolling in his sleep.<br>
            Deciding to come back with Audun the next time, the party returns to Skargat with their mithral loot.
